# PROJECT_8_Customer_Churn_Analysis
                 
## 📌 Overview  
Customer churn analysis helps businesses understand why customers stop using their services. This project focuses on analyzing churn patterns and building predictive models to identify at-risk customers.
 
## 📊 Objectives
- Analyze customer data to identify churn patterns.
- Build machine learning models to predict churn.
- Provide insights for reducing customer attrition.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- The dataset includes customer demographics, usage behavior, subscription details, and churn status.
- Features like **tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and support interactions** are used for analysis.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression** (Modeling)

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Selection & Training  
5. Evaluation & Optimization  
6. Insights & Recommendations  

## 📈 Key Findings
- High monthly charges and short tenure increase churn probability.
- Customers on **monthly contracts** are more likely to churn.
- **Loyalty programs & better customer support** can reduce churn.


## 📌 Future Improvements
- Deploying the model as a **web app** for real-time predictions.
- Incorporating **deep learning models** for better accuracy.
- Using **real-time customer feedback** for enhanced predictions.
